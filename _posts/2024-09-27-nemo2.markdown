Tool that applies bit-blasting to encode arithmetic expressions as propositional formulas and standards such as the Universal Variability Language (UVL). This allows products to be efficiently counted by #SAT solvers and BDDs, enabling the discovery of near-optimal products. Collaboration between UMA and the University of Texas at Austin (Don Batory, United States).
