A customizable and extensible implementation of the execution engine for the Common Variability Language (CVL).

vEXgine fully supports the materialization process, including the delegation mechanism that can be extended with different delegation engines.

It includes an implementation of the delegation engine based on Model-to-Model transformations using a general purpose transformation language such as ATL.

The provided Java API of the execution engine allows extending the CVL approach to fulfill the industrial needs for variability modeling in Software Product Lines.
